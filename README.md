# No-Admin-Cmd Prompt
This Cmd Prompt does not require admin - and only one minor downside.

This code is like 4 lines so really we should thank python for having the subprocess module already downloaded.



# The downside
sadly, I don't know how to display the directory or path cuz subprocess basically just opens a terminal and enters the code in that we inputted then closes after its done and returns with a status code.
Plus also subproccess is a little broken with anything to do with directory or path when just using a PI - so make sure you use a file.

# Tutorial
firstly - downloading python.
(https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3132/) <- make sure to select the windows installer 64 bit.
This version of python requires no admin - since it is portable and doesn't need to mess around with your files and whatnot.
this depends on your school's IT - mine is very strict, basically all downloading is blocked - if yours isnt then you can just go to the link and download it straight up
if your school is strict - hopefully this method works like it did for our computers. Firstly try and download it - once it fails copy the download link and paste in a new tab - that simple. Now open up the installer, no Admin perms are required so you can just go and install no problem. Now that we've downloaded python - you need to download the terminal file.
